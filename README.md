# UI-UX-Experiment4

## Aim:
To Design a wireframe diagram for a generic application or website

Algorithm:

## Algorithm:
1.Identify the purpose of the application and its target users.

2.List key features required (e.g., image feed, search bar, upload option, profile page).

3.Create an information hierarchy â€” decide how content will be structured and prioritized.

4.Sketch low-fidelity layouts for main screens (home, search, upload, profile).

5.Arrange UI components like navigation bar, buttons, image cards, and icons.

6.Add annotations to describe functionality and navigation between screens.

7.Review and refine the layout based on usability and visual balance.

8.Convert to a digital wireframe using a tool (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch).
